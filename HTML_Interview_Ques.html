    <p>Empty elements, also known as void or self-closing elements, are HTML elements that do not contain any
        content or
        nested elements. They are typically represented by a single tag, without a corresponding closing tag.
    </p>

    <h3>Ques59 - What is the use of a span tag? Give one example</h3>
    <p>The < span> tag is an inline container used to group or target a piece of text or inline elements for
            styling or
            scripting.</p>
    <p>This is a < span style="color: red;">red</span> word in a sentence.</p>

    <h3>Ques60 - What is the use of an iframe tag?</h3>

            current
            webpage.</p>

    <h3>Ques61 - What are the entities in HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that are either reserved characters in HTML
        (like
        <,>, &, and "), characters not easily typed on a keyboard (like ©, ®, ™, or characters with accents), or
            invisible characters (like spaces). They allow you to display these characters correctly in your web
            page,
            even if they have a special meaning in HTML or are difficult to input directly.
    </p>

    <h3>Ques62 - Why is a URL encoded in HTML?</h3>
    <p>URL encoding converts characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet. URLs can only
        be sent
        over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. Since URLs often contain characters outside the ASCII
        set, the
        URL has to be converted into a valid ASCII format.</p>

    <h3>Ques63 - Does a < !DOCTYPE html> tag is a HTML tag?</h3>
    <p>No, < !DOCTYPE html> is not an HTML tag; it's a document type declaration (DTD) that tells the browser
            which
            version of HTML the document is written in. It's a declaration, not a tag, and it helps the browser
            interpret the document correctly.</p>

    <h3>Ques64 - What is the canvas element in HTML5?</h3>
    <p>The < canvas> element is an HTML5 feature that lets you draw graphics on the fly using JavaScript. It's
            like a
            blank drawing area in your web page.</p>

    <h3>Ques65 - What is SVG?</h3>
    <p>SVG, or Scalable Vector Graphics, is a web-based, XML-based vector image format. It's designed for
        displaying
        two-dimensional graphics, charts, and illustrations on the web, and offers advantages like resolution
        independence and good integration with other web standards.</p>

    <h3>Ques66 - What are the different new form element types in HTML 5?</h3>
    <p>There are five new form elements in the HTML5 forms specification: datalist , output , keygen , progress
        , and
        meter</p>

            <td>value, min, max, low, high, optimum</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Ques71 - What is the use of figure tag in HTML 5?</h3>
    <p>The < figure> tag is used to insert self-contained content such as illustrations, diagrams, photos, or
            code
            listings in a document</p>

    <h3>Ques72 - What is the use of figcaption tag in HTML 5?</h3>
    <p>The < figcaption> tag defines a caption for a < figure> element. The < figcaption> element can be placed
                    as the
                    first or last child of the < figure> element.</p>

    <h3>Ques73 - What is button tag?</h3>
    <p>
        < button> tag defines a clickable button on a webpage that users can interact with. It is often used
            within
            forms
            to submit data or trigger JavaScript functions.
    </p>

    <h3>Ques74 - What is the use of details and summary tag?</h3>
    <p>The details and summary HTML tags are used together to create a disclosure widget, often referred to as
        an
        accordion, where content can be shown or hidden by the user. The summary tag provides a visible label or
        title
        for the hidden content, while the details tag acts as a container for both the summary and the content
        to be
        revealed.</p>

    <h3>Ques75 - What is datalist tag?</h3>
    <p>The HTML < datalist> tag defines a list of pre-defined options for an < input> element, providing an
                autocomplete
                feature. When a user interacts with the associated input field, a dropdown list of these options
                appears, allowing users to select from the predefined choices. This tag is new in HTML5.</p>

    <h3>Ques76 - How are tags migrated from HTML4 to HTML5?</h3>
    <p>When HTML5 was developed, it aimed to simplify and modernize HTML4 by adding new elements, removing outdated
        ones, and redefining some old tags for better semantics and functionality.</p>

    <h3>Ques77 - If I do not put < !DOCTYPE html> will HTML 5 work?</h3>
    <p>
        DOCTYPE html> at the beginning of every site page to ensure the web browser loading your website uses
        the latest
        web practices from HTML 5 and higher. Omitting the DOCTYPE declaration will break many “newer” site
        tags, such
        as
        < header> and < footer>, and render your site improperly to the end user.
    </p>

    <h3>Ques78 - What is the use of the required attribute in HTML5?</h3>
    <p>The required attribute in HTML5 is used to specify that a form field must be filled out before a form can
        be
        submitted</p>

    <h3>Ques79 - What are the new < input> types for form validation in HTML5?</h3>
    <p> HTML5 introduced new < input> types that make form validation easier and more user-friendly — without
            needing
            extra JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Input Typ - email, url, tel, number, range, date, time, datetime-local, month, week, color</p>

    <h3>Ques80 - HTML is case-sensitive or not?</h3>
    <p>No, HTML is not case-sensitive. You can use uppercase or lowercase letters for HTML tags and attributes
        without
        affecting how the browser interprets them</p>

    <h3>Ques81 - When are comments used in HTML?</h3>
    <p>In HTML, comments are used to add explanatory text within the code that is not displayed by the browser.
    </p>

    <h3>Ques82 - What are Attributes and how do you use them?</h3>
    <p>Attributes are characteristics or properties that describe an element, object, or concept. They provide
        additional information or modify the behavior of something</p>

    <h3>Ques83 - What do you mean by for attributes in label tag.</h3>
    <p>The for attribute specifies which form element a label is bound to.</p>

    <h3>Ques84 - How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?</h3>
    <p>To create a hyperlink in HTML, use the <a> (anchor) tag with the href attribute, which specifies the URL
            of the
            link's destination. The text or content within the <a> tags will be displayed as the clickable link.
    </p>
    <pre>
        < a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example< /a>
    </pre>

    <h3>Ques85 - Name some common lists that are used when designing a page.
    </h3>
    <p>Common lists used in web page design include unordered lists (< ul>), ordered lists (< ol>), and
                definition lists
                (< dl>)</p>

    <h3>Ques86 - Which attributes is required in input tag.</h3>
    <p> In the < input> tag, the only truly required attribute for it to make sense is the type attribute — but
            even
            that has a default.</p>

    <h3>Ques87 - What do you mean by MARKUP language and hypertext in HTML?</h3>
    <p>In HTML, hypertext refers to the links that connect web pages or parts of a document, while markup
        language
        defines the structure and content of a web page using tags</p>

    <h3>Ques89 - How are active links different from normal links?</h3>
    <p>Active links are hyperlinks that are currently being interacted with by the user, like when a user clicks
        on
        them. Normal links, on the other hand, are simply links that can be clicked to navigate to another page
        or
        location, and they don't necessarily have any active state associated with them.</p>

    <h3>Ques90 - What happens if there is no text between the tags? Does this affect the display of the HTML
        file?</h3>
    <p>If there is no text between HTML tags, the browser will still render the element, but it will appear
        empty. The
        element will still occupy space on the page based on its defined properties (like width, height,
        padding,
        margin, etc.), unless specifically styled to be hidden or collapsed. While it won't cause a display
        error, it's
        generally not good practice to have empty elements, as it can make code harder to read and maintain.</p>

    <h3>Ques91 - What are the limits of the text field size?</h3>
    <p>The limits of a text field's size depend on the specific context, such as the programming language,
        database, or
        platform being used. Generally, text fields can be limited in length by setting a maximum character
        count, but
        the maximum theoretical limit can vary greatly</p>

    <h3>Ques92 - What is the relationship between the border and rule attributes?</h3>
    <p>The border and rules attributes in HTML tables are both used to control the display of borders, but they
        affect
        different aspects of the table's appearance. The border attribute primarily controls the overall frame
        of the
        table, while the rules attribute specifies which internal borders (between rows and columns) should be
        displayed
    </p>

    <h3>Ques93 - What is Cell Spacing and Cell Padding?</h3>
    <p>In HTML tables, cell spacing refers to the space between table cells, while cell padding refers to the
        space
        between the content within a cell and its border. Cell spacing controls the gaps between adjacent cells,
        while
        cell padding controls the space inside a cell</p>

    <h3>Ques94 - What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) are both markup
        languages used
        for creating web pages, but XHTML is a stricter, more structured version of HTML that is based on XML.
        XHTML
        enforces rules about syntax, tag closure, and case sensitivity that are not required in HTML.</p>

    <h3>Ques95 - How many types of CSS can be included in HTML?</h3>
    <p>There are three ways to include CSS in an HTML document: inline, internal, and external</p>
    <p>Inline CSS: Styles are applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute</p>
    <p>Internal CSS: Styles are defined within the < style> element in the < head> section of the HTML document
    </p>
    <p>External CSS: Styles are written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the < link>
            tag in
            the < head> section</p>

    <h3>Ques96 - What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</h3>
    <p>In HTML, logical tags convey the meaning or purpose of the text, while physical tags dictate the visual
        appearance of the text. Logical tags like < strong> and < em> emphasize text semantically, whereas
                physical tags
                like < b> and < i> directly format text for bold and italic styles, respectively</p>

    <h3>Ques97 - How can you apply JavaScript to a web page?</h3>
    <p>The < script> tag can be placed in the < head> section of your HTML or in the < body> section, depending
                    on when
                    you want the JavaScript to load. Generally, JavaScript code can go inside the document < head>
                        section in order to keep it contained and out of the main content of your HTML document
    </p>

    <h3>Ques98 - How to make you radio button and check-box. and how to implement this??</h3>
    <p>Radio buttons and checkboxes are both form elements used for user input, but they serve different
        purposes. Radio
        buttons allow users to select only one option from a group, while checkboxes allow users to select
        multiple
        options. To implement them, you use the < input> element with the type attribute set to radio or
            checkbox,
            respectively. You group radio buttons using the same name attribute for them</p>

    <h3>Ques99 - What is main reason or main advantage of label tag?</h3>
    <p>It associates text with a form control (like < input>, < textarea>, < select>), making it clear what the
                    user
                    should enter.</p>

    <h3>Ques100 - How will you implement when you click on submit button your whole data comes in URL form?</h3>
    <p>When you want the form data to appear in the URL:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use method="GET" in your < form>.</li>
        <li>When you click Submit, the browser appends the form data to the URL as query parameters.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Example Implementation</p>
    <p>

    <pre>
        <form action="submit.html" method="GET">
            <label for="username">Username:</label>
            <input type="text" id="username" name="username">

            <label for="age">Age:</label>
            <input type="number" id="age" name="age">

            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    </pre>
    </p>

    <p>What happens when you submit?</p>
    <p>If you enter:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Username: John</li>
        <li>Age: 25</li>
    </ul>
    <p>submit.html?username=John&age=25
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre>
            submit.html?username=John&age=25
        </pre>
    </p>




</body>
